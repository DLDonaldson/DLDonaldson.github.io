I graduated with a BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Summa Cum Laude) from California Baptist University, USA in 2012. From 2011 to 2018, I worked for Southern California Edison (SCE), one of the largest electric utilities in the United States in roles spanning Distribution Engineering, Transmission Planning, and Demand & Distributed Energy Resource Forecasting. While at SCE I completed my MEng in Electrical Engineering from the University of Idaho (2015), and also was licensed as a Professional Engineer in the State of California (2015).

In 2018, I left SCE to pursue a PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University of Birmingham, where my research focused on resilience assessment of electrical power systems with wildfires and low-carbon technologies. After completing my PhD in 2022 I took up the post of Assistant Professor at the University of Birmingham.
